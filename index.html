                  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                  Setmore Revamp is a mobile application designed to improve the current appointment scheduling software, Setmore. The applicationâ€™s main goal is to provide users with a tool that allows them to efficiently book and manage their personal care services. The application provides a large selection of services while also ensuring that users are not overwhelmed by the choices. This was achieved by designing the app with a variety of design principles which are collectively used to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
                  The team incorporated a variety of design principles during the development of the app. These design principles were used to ensure that our final application was functional, maintainable, and scalable. Some design principles include Visibility while displaying services, Familiarity for the search bar display and Progressive Disclosure to reduce screen clutter, etc. These principles are used to present information in an easy to navigate way, with the most relevant information being displayed first and less important data getting revealed gradually as the user requests it. 
                  The Setmore Revamp application has various screens including the login screen, home screen, search screen, favorites screen, calendar screen and notifications screen.
