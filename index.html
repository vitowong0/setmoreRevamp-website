                  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                  Setmore is an all-in-one scheduling platform used by businesses to manage their online booking, reminders, payments, and more. Service providers create and manage their own pages for their customers to interact with and book appointments, classes, and services. Setmore gives providers the power to automate appointment scheduling, manage their calendars, send appointment reminders, and more. The target audience for tends to be beauty and wellness (barbers, estheticians) providers, fitness trainers, and personal consultants.

For the customer, the Setmore experience is nowhere near as pleasant as for the provider. The customer website has a poor interface that does not follow good design principles, sticks to a very bare bones design with nothing special, and does not flow smoothly. In many senses, booking an appointment with the current Setmore is as boring and uninspiring as filling in a survey. On top of that, they do not have a customer app and their mobile website is not optimized for small displays.

Our goal was to completely redesign the goals of Setmore and to create a mobile app for the customer. To begin, we implemented a simple 5-page tab bar navigator. This is commonly used in almost all mobile apps and is widely accepted as the norm for app navigation. To make booking and searching easier for the user, we created grid tiles for every company. These are split into various sections (available now, recommended for you, nearby, and favourites). The user can explore nearby services using the Search screen, and ‘favourited’ services using the Favourites screen. All of this creates a stark contrast to the existing Setmore, which includes no browsing and only allows booking with the company who’s page the customer is on. When the user decides to book, they enter our multi-stage process. First, they select the company’s grid tile, which brings them to a company details page. Here they can see what the company offers, any reviews, and the available staff members. Clicking on any staff member will then bring you to a service selection page, where the customer can pick and choose from all the offered services. Then, the user selects a date using our intuitive and colour-coded calendar, followed by a time slot. The user then confirms the booking and is sent to a booking confirmation page. From there, they can modify or cancel the appointment, and will either be redirected to the date selection page or an appointment cancel page. We have changed the booking process from the ground-up to involve the user more, provide feedback, and guide them through the steps.

The user interacts with our SetmoreRevamp app the same way they would with any other mobile app - by using the interaction style of manipulating. Traditional swipe, tap, scroll, pinch, and multi-touch-gesture controls work with our app. The main navigation is done via tapping the tab bar navigator, scrolling is used throughout carousels, and pinch-to-zoom can be used in all images. A natural language interface is incorporated into the search bar, where the customer can tell the app what they’re looking for. Haptic feedback is provided when customers reach a ‘dead end’. For example, they will feel a small vibration when selecting a date that is unavailable, inputting text via keyboard, or reaching the end of a scrolling carousel. The micro-level interaction of drilling is used when the user begins the booking process. As they proceed step-by-step, more information is revealed to them (in terms of their booking options). In most cases, our system follows a reactive style - that is, changes are not made unless the user does an action.
