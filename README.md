# setmoreRevamp-website

Final project for Computer Science 4474 - Human Computer Interaction, at Western University.

Our project is to improve the user's experience with Setmore, a popular service booking app. We want to make it easier for the customer to browse, select, and book appointments. At the moment, they lack a customer app - so we are creating one.

This is the report for our project. Follow the links below to see it and all other deliverables.
